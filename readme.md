All right, as of 10 April 2020, this doesn't work.

Waiting for https://github.com/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/261.

That's fine, because I've been working on my own peer-to-peer notebook, and if
GistPad and Codespaces worked together, it would be better for me to abandom my
projects and just teach all my friends for whom I build that notebook to write
Markdown.

The idea is, if [GistPad](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gistfs) and GitHub Codespaces (Press <kbd>.</kbd> when you're reading this.) work together,
they provide a nice text editor for collaborative notes even for people who are not using VSCode.
